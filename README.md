# Artificial Intelligence 101 (EEA IITK)

This repository contains Python implementations of assignments and experiments completed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence 101** project under the **Electrical Engineers Association**, **IIT Kanpur** (Dec 2024 – Mar 2025).

The goal of this project was to explore core machine learning concepts through hands-on implementation of foundational models across classification, representation learning, kernel methods, and probabilistic regression.
